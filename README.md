# AWS-Glue-Concurrent

What is Concurrency in AWS Glue?
Concurrency in AWS Glue refers to the ability to run multiple Glue jobs or job runs in parallel. Glue allows concurrent job runs to handle multiple data processing tasks at the same time. This is particularly useful for large-scale ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines that need to process multiple datasets simultaneously.


Key Aspects of AWS Glue Concurrency
Default Maximum Concurrent Job Runs: The default limit is 3 concurrent runs per job.
Increasing Concurrency: You can request an AWS service quota increase if you need more than 10 concurrent runs.
Worker Capacity: The number of DPUs (Data Processing Units) affects how efficiently Glue can process jobs concurrently.
Job Execution Mode:
Standard: One job instance runs at a time.
Concurrent Runs: Multiple instances of the same job can run at the same time with different input parameters.

Where is Glue Concurrency Used?
Glue concurrency is useful in various real-world data processing scenarios, such as:

A. Parallel Data Ingestion from S3
Suppose a company receives data from multiple sources (e.g., different regions, departments).
Instead of processing all datasets sequentially, multiple Glue jobs can run concurrently, processing data for different regions at the same time.
B. Running ETL Pipelines for Different Clients in Parallel
If a SaaS company processes customer-specific data transformations, each customerâ€™s data pipeline can run as a separate concurrent Glue job with different input parameters.


How to Enable Glue Job Concurrency?
To run Glue jobs concurrently, you need to:
âœ… Use Step Functions or EventBridge to trigger multiple jobs simultaneously.
âœ… Pass different input parameters (e.g., S3 locations) to each Glue job.
âœ… Optimize DPUs and worker allocation to handle the load.
âœ… Increase concurrency limits if needed (AWS service quota request).


Conclusion
AWS Glue concurrency allows for efficient parallel data processing. It is widely used in:
âœ” Big Data ETL Pipelines
âœ” Streaming Data Processing
âœ” Data Warehousing & Analytics
âœ” Parallel Job Execution for Different Clients

ðŸ’¡ If you need to process multiple datasets quickly, using Glue concurrency with Step Functions, Lambda, and EventBridge is an excellent approach!
